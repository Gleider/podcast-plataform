## Dependencies

This library depends on [fetch](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/) to make requests to the Gpoddernet API. For environments that don't support fetch, you'll need to provide a [polyfill](https://github.com/github/fetch) to browser or [polyfill](https://github.com/bitinn/node-fetch) to Node.
